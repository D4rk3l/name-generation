# Mimic Tools' Character Name Generation
A tool to generate character names for your RPGs, Novel or any sort of character creation.

## Current Status

Our "Dwarf" name generator is undergoing development, which will pave the way for the other generators. These changes should eventually help:
- Less disparity between what races/origins can have certain titles
- Removing ties to race and focussing on origin/heritage.
> example: if your tiefling character was brought up by dwarves in a cave, it's more likely they'd have a dwarven inspired name than one from the hells.
- More re-use of name components.
> No more putting "John" into all the databanks.

## Seeking Contribution

We are participating in #hacktoberfest and welcome (meaningful) contribution.

### Non-technical
You can help populate our name banks. In particular, our name 'decorators' such as titles, etc. could use some additional words. Have a look around the name-segments folder for what you can contribute to

We also would love your input on the formation of names. 
> example: Dwarven surnames could be made up of a adjective + noun
> Trueaxe. Blackmountain. Fasthammer.

### Technical
We are editing the core right now, so any core generation code is not a stable place to start, but any issues in https://github.com/Mimic-Tools/name-generation/issues are fair game! Additionally, any standalone scripts!

## Hurdles
Our project is evolving and while we wish our final product to be as inclusive as possible for all valid configurations, we will be starting at a simple base.
Please be patient with us as we try to best formulate how to enable all sorts of variations, cross-use of names, structural options, etc.

If you feel strongly about any decisions made, please raise an issue https://github.com/Mimic-Tools/name-generation/issues and we will do our best to resolve it, without hampering our project's trajectory.

Finally comply with our file naming and style conventions.
